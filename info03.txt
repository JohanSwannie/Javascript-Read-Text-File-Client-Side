Project implementation that relies on strategic planning outlined earlier in 
the process can help a team achieve the project objectives while staying 
within budget and meeting relevant deadlines. Implementation is the part of 
the project cycle that bridges the planning process and the project outcomes. 
This step of the process, and how well it's executed, can ultimately determine 
the success of a project.
