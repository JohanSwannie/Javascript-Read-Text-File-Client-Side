Project implementation is the process of putting a project plan into action,
to produce the deliverables otherwise known as the products or services 
for clients or stakeholders. It takes place after the planning phase, 
during which a team determines the key objectives for the project, as well 
as the timeline and budget. Implementation involves coordinating resources 
and measuring performance to ensure the project remains within its expected 
scope and budget. It also involves handling any unforeseen issues in a way 
that keeps a project running smoothly.
